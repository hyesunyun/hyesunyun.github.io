  abstract  = {Keeping users engaged with mHealth applications is important but difficult to achieve. We describe the development of a smartphone-based application designed to promote health and wellness in church communities, along with mechanisms explicitly designed to maintain engagement. We evaluated religiously tailored techno-spiritual engagement mechanisms, including a prayer posting wall, pastor announcements, an embodied conversational agent for dialogue-based scriptural reflections and health coaching, and tailored push notifications. We conducted a four-week pilot study with 25 participants from two churches, measuring high levels of participant acceptance and satisfaction with all features of the application. Engagement with the app was higher for users considered to be more religious and correlated with the number of notifications received. Our findings demonstrate that our tailored mechanisms can increase engagement with an mHealth app.},

  abstract = {We developed a virtual agent that motivates church-going users to change their health behavior by telling existing cultural narratives that have high relevance with the counseling topic in an engaging way. We evaluated this agent in a between-subjects experiment where participants interacted with an agent that counseled them on nutrition either without a story, with a story but told in a neutral speech style, or with a story using dramatic delivery inspired by church sermons. We found that interaction with either one of the storytelling agents leads to a significantly greater change in confidence to engage in the target behavior of healthy eating than interacting with a non-storytelling agent, demonstrating the efficacy of stories in health counseling by virtual agents.},

abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study is to describe and pilot a novel method for continuously identifying newly published trials relevant to a systematic review, enabled by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with human expertise.
Study Design and Setting
We used RobotReviewer LIVE to keep a review of COVID-19 vaccination trials updated from February to August 2021. We compared the papers identified by the system with those found by the conventional manual process by the review team.
Results
The manual update searches (last search date July 2021) retrieved 135 abstracts, of which 31 were included after screening (23% precision, 100% recall). By the same date, the automated system retrieved 56 abstracts, of which 31 were included after manual screening (55% precision, 100% recall). Key limitations of the system include that it is limited to searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, and considers only randomized controlled trial reports. We aim to address these limitations in future. The system is available as open-source software for further piloting and evaluation.
Conclusion
Our system identified all relevant studies, reduced manual screening work, and enabled rolling updates on publication of new primary research.},

  abstract = {Speaker diarization is a key component of systems that support multiparty interactions of co-located users, such as meeting facilitation robots. The goal is to identify who spoke what, often to provide feedback, moderate participation, and personalize responses by the robot. Current systems use a combination of acoustic (e.g. pitch differences) and visual features (e.g. gaze) to perform diarization, but involve the use of additional sensors or require overhead signal processing efforts. Alternatively, automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a necessary step in the diarization pipeline, and utilizing the transcribed text to directly identify speaker labels in the conversation can eliminate such challenges. With that motivation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify speaker labels from transcribed text and observe an exact match of 77% and a word level accuracy of 90%. We discuss our findings and the potential use of LLMs as a diarization tool for future systems.},
