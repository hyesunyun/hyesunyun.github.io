  abstract = {We developed a virtual agent that motivates church-going users to change their health behavior by telling existing cultural narratives that have high relevance with the counseling topic in an engaging way. We evaluated this agent in a between-subjects experiment where participants interacted with an agent that counseled them on nutrition either without a story, with a story but told in a neutral speech style, or with a story using dramatic delivery inspired by church sermons. We found that interaction with either one of the storytelling agents leads to a significantly greater change in confidence to engage in the target behavior of healthy eating than interacting with a non-storytelling agent, demonstrating the efficacy of stories in health counseling by virtual agents.},

  abstract = {Speaker diarization is a key component of systems that support multiparty interactions of co-located users, such as meeting facilitation robots. The goal is to identify who spoke what, often to provide feedback, moderate participation, and personalize responses by the robot. Current systems use a combination of acoustic (e.g. pitch differences) and visual features (e.g. gaze) to perform diarization, but involve the use of additional sensors or require overhead signal processing efforts. Alternatively, automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a necessary step in the diarization pipeline, and utilizing the transcribed text to directly identify speaker labels in the conversation can eliminate such challenges. With that motivation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify speaker labels from transcribed text and observe an exact match of 77% and a word level accuracy of 90%. We discuss our findings and the potential use of LLMs as a diarization tool for future systems.},
