I will be attending this year's AHLI Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) conference at Berkeley, CA. During the poster session tomorrow (June 26), I will be presenting our paper [Caught in the Web of Words: Do LLMs Fall for Spin in Medical Literature?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07963).
