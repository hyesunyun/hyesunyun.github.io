## Instructor of Record

### DS2500: Intermediate Programming with Data

**Fall 2025**

DS 2500 offers intermediate to advanced Python programming for data science. Covers object-oriented design patterns using Python, including encapsulation, composition, and inheritance. Advanced programming skills cover software architecture, recursion, profiling, unit testing and debugging, lineage and data provenance, using advanced integrated development environments, and software control systems. Uses case studies to survey key concepts in data science with an emphasis on machine-learning (classification, clustering, deep learning); data visualization; and natural language processing. Additional assigned readings survey topics in ethics, model bias, and data privacy pertinent to today's big data world. Offers students an opportunity to prepare for more advanced courses in data science and to enable practical contributions to software development and data science projects in a commercial setting.

### CS4973/CS6983: Research in Human-Centered NLP

**Spring 2025**

This undergraduate and masters special topics course aims to provide a human-centered perspective toward modern language technologies and highlights research topics shared between Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this course, students will learn and apply research methods for designing and developing human-centered NLP applications and systems. As part of the course, we will read research papers at the intersection of NLP and HCI and practice critically evaluating them to identify future research directions. The course should help students gain the skills and confidence to pursue research at the intersection of HCI and NLP.
